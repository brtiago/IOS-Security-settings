# Settings to improve iOS security and privacy

>This is a work in progress on some settings i personally use for making iOS more secure and private. If you think i should add or change something tell me.

Some of the settings here change big parts of iOS i don't expect anyone to use them all.

>(Keeping the device up to date is very important)

    Enable SIM Pin lookup your carriers default pin don't guess | "Settings / Cellular / SIM Pin"

    No FaceID/TouchID only number or alphanumeric passwords | "Settings / Face ID And Password"

    Enable 10 Failed password attempts wipes device | "Settings / Face ID And Password / Very bottom (Erase Data)" (This might also be under Touch ID And Password)

    Disable all lock screen utility's | "Settings / Face ID And Password / "ALLOW ACCESS WHEN LOCKED" disable all"

    Hide notifications when device is locked | "Setting / Notifications / Show Previews = (When Unlocked)"

    Use a network firewall to block trackers ext (The app lockdown is open source)

    Disable background app refresh on most apps | "Settings / General / Background App Refresh"

    Enable Find My iPhone | "Settings / Apple ID / Find My iPhone / Find My iPhone (Enable All)"

    Create long secure iCloud password with 2FA

    Disable Bluetooth when not in use

    Disable WiFi auto connect from settings

    Get a trusted VPN for public networks

    Disable siri / "hey siri" and the siri suggestions | "Settings / Siri And Search (Disable All)"

    Disable Raise to listen | "Settings / Messages / Audio Messages"

    Disable Predictive | "Settings / General / Keyboard"

    Set Auto-Lock to 30 seconds | "Settings / Display And Brightness / Auto-Lock"

    Set location services to "while using" or off | "Settings / Privacy / Location Services"

    ^ Also under "System Service" disable all under "Product Improvements" "Significant locations"

    ^ "Location-Based Alerts" "Location-Based Apple Ads" and "Location-Based Suggestions"

    Disable everything under "Analytics And Improvements" "Settings / Privacy / Analytics And Improvements"

    Under "Advertising" Enable "Limit Ad Tracking" "Settings / Privacy / Advertising"

    If you plan to do manual backups to a pc it would be a good idea to disable iCloud backups and any sort of iCloud syncing. | "Settings / Apple ID / iCloud"

    The Fitness tracking collects a lot of information so i would disable it | "Settings / Privacy / Motion And Fitness / Set to off"

    Any app that ask for microphone access and doesn't need it should be turned off | "Settings / Privacy / Microphone / Then change what you want"

    ^ The same should be done with all other tabs in the privacy settings

    Disable screen time if enabled, unless you use it to block specific apps or to require a password for account changes / password changes | "Settings / Screen Time"

    Disable Siri And Search in Phone "Settings / Phone / Siri And Search (Disable All)"

    I would personally silence calls from unknown callers but that's not the best idea for everyone | "Settings / Phone / Silence Unknown Callers (Off)"

    Disable the default iOS password manager and use something like Bitwarden or a local password manager | "Settings / Password / Accounts / AutoFill Password / Uncheck "iCloud Keychain" and check Bitwarden or your password manager" Also you might want to remove the saved passwords from keychain in the previous page under "Websites And App Passwords"

    Remove apps you don't use and replace apps you do with open source apps listed on https://www.privacytools.io

**If you use the default mail app here's some settings to change**

    Disable the loading of remote images | "Settings / Mail / Load Remote Images"

    Disable Siri And Search | "Settings / Mail Siri / Search / Disable all"

    Change the mail fetch to manual to save battery life and keep background activity low (This will keep mail from automatically updating meaning no notifications) | "Settings / Passwords / Accounts / Fetch New Data / Under Fetch pick manually" I would also turn push off and switch all options to fetch"

**Settings that improve Safari**

    Change Safari "Search Engine" to DuckDuckGo| "Settings / Safari / Search Engine (DuckDuckGo)"

    Turn off "Search Engine Suggestions" "Safari Suggestions" and "Preload Top Hit"

    In "Settings / Safari / Advanced / Experimental Features" Enable "Automatic HTTPS Upgrade"
